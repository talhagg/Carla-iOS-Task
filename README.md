# Talha Golcugezli - Carla iOS Task

**Purpose of the App:**

MVVM architecture is used. Protocol Oriented Programming and Modular structure are used.
Third party libraries I used: Alamofire, SDWebImage

**Important Note:**
For the latest photo, http was used instead of https, when we tried via postman, the api call could not be made with https, so we went to the api documentation and made examinations there and it was observed that it was http.
Since I had an access problem on GitHub, my commit messages were too many, I apologise for this situation.

** When the https://mars-photos.herokuapp.com/api/v1/rovers api was checked, since the rover images did not come, image urls were added to the localisable string file and the rovers images were taken from there.**
